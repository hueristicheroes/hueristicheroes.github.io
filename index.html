                    When taking a photograph, typical cameras commonly use three color channels to capture an image: red, green, and blue. Spectral imaging is an imaging technique that uses multiple bands of light to produce high quality images and has a wide array of applications, such as art conservation and producing more color accurate images. While spectral imaging is a technique that is commonly used by scientists working in large museums, it is conceptually complex and requires expensive imaging equipment and software that is inaccessible to most photographers. The Studio for Scientific Imaging and Archiving of Cultural Heritage is a facility within the RIT Program of Color Science’s Munsell Color Science Lab. The Studio seeks to make the power of spectral imaging accessible and inexpensive, enabling cultural heritage photographers around the world to produce color accurate images. <br><br>
    
                    Their solution is “Beyond RGB”, a free and open source software application. Beyond RGB enables photographers to take photos using their standard RGB camera and produce a much more color accurate image. The application provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface, and handles all the complex image processing and mathematical operations behind the scenes. This year, the Studio is seeking to release “Beyond RGB 2.0”, which will have  improved processing, color calibration, program flexibility, an updated calibration report, as well as batch processing for multiple photos.
